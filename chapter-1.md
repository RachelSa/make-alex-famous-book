"Ugh, the blurs," thought Dicky. His sneaker toe had gotten caught on a woman's oversized tote bag as she hurried through the bus's upper deck aisle, whacking passers-by in the head with her mammoth purse.

It was two in the morning and the harsh lights of the MegaBus had just zapped on, signaling their arrival at South Station. People were always frantic getting on and off the bus, darting in front of each other as if the saved two seconds was going to make a difference in their arrival time.

Of course, for Dicky, arriving at the destination wasn't really the point. For him, the feel of the open MegaBus road was enough to spark a fire deep within him.

The fire was kindled by his two loves:

 1. Freedom. 
 
It was what Dicky had been seeking since he was six years old and hopped on the back of a flatbed truck for the     first  time, just to see where it would go. Turned out the truck was owned by the local port-o-potty rental company, and only       drove two miles down the street, stopping in a gravel, sewage-smelling parking lot. But still, Dicky had tasted it--         spontaneity, urine, adventure.

It was why, at age eleven, he hugged his parents goodbye; patted his dog KatzyKatz on the head; gently tapped the top of his xbox; said hasta la vista to a generous trust fund which was to be released monthly, pending graduation from the sixth    grade; and swung his backpack over his shoulder as he headed out the front door.

"We always said we wouldn't be helicopter parents," his father said, placing arm around mother's shoulder. "I just didn't  expect it to be this hard."

 2. Assuming false identities. 
 
Luckily, Dicky had developed a substaintail amount of facial hair by the end of the summer before fifth grade. It's    something that his father had been proud of, teaching Dicky to shave at the age of ten. It was the same age Dicky's step brother Alex had learned to shave, as well as Dicky's father, grandfather, and great-grandfather. 
  
Even in fifth grade, Dicky was sometimes mistaken for an adult, which is how he first got interested in false identities.  Sometimes on weekends, Dicky would put on a polo shirt and the pants his mom had bought him for his grandmother's funeral,  and wander around a department store, waiting for customers to approach him with questions. He would pretend to be         unfamiliar with the product a customer was describing and ask for them to go into great detail about what they were looking  for. After three minutes exactly, he would pretend to finally understand and guide the customer to the appropriate section.
  
 It was great fun.

  

It was the combination of these traits that led Dicky on his first adventure, one that would later be known as "Kid on a Cold Tin Roof".
