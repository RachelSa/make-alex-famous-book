"Ugh, the blurs," thought Dicky. His sneaker toe had gotten caught on a woman's oversized tote bag as she hurried through the bus's upper deck aisle, whacking passers-by in the head with her mammoth purse.

It was two in the morning and the harsh lights of the MegaBus had just zapped on, signaling their arrival at South Station. People were always frantic getting on and off the bus, darting in front of each other as if the saved two seconds was going to make a difference in their arrival time.

Of course, for Dicky, arriving at the destination wasn't really the point. For him, the feel of the open MegaBus road was enough to spark a fire deep within him.

The fire was kindled by his two loves:

 1. Freedom. It was what Dicky had been seeking since he was six years old and hopped on the back of a flatbed truck for the first time, just to see where it would go. Turned out the truck was owned by the local port-o-potty rental company, and only drove two miles down the street, stopping in a gravel, sewage-smelling parking lot. But still, Dicky had tasted it--spontaneity, urine, adventure.

 It was why, at age eleven, he hugged his parents goodbye; patted his dog KatzyKatz on the head; gently tapped the top of his xbox; said hasta la vista to a generous trust fund which was to be released monthly, pending graduation from the sixth grade; and swung his backpack over his shoulder as he headed out the front door.

 "We always said we wouldn't be helicopter parents," his father said, placing arm around mother's shoulder. "I just didn't expect it to be this hard."

It was the combination of these traits that led Dicky on his first adventure, one that would later be known as "Kid on a Cold Tin Roof".  (<-- keep, this fits the aesthetic -->)
