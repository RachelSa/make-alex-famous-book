# make-alex-famous-book
A collaborative novel-writing project, featuring Alex's already-famous, kid-living-on-a-bus premise.

## wat
Write a novel together using that goldmine young adult novel premise dreamed up by first-place modeloing cross country runner && elite programmer, Alex, while on a bus trip. 

I've gotten things started in [chapter one](https://github.com/RachelSa/make-alex-famous-book/blob/master/chapter-1.md) so you can see the beginnings of Alex's idea. Essentially, a teenager lives on a Megabus, claiming a row of seats as his home while he travels between cities. Of course, he's surrounded by the other non-resident passengers, whom the character refers to as 'the blurs'.

## why
